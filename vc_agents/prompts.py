   - Identify basic information: name, description, founding year, location, website

2. **Key People Analysis**
   - Research founders and executive team members
   - Look for their backgrounds, previous companies, and relevant experience
   - Identify key advisors or board members if available

3. **Business Model Investigation**
   - Analyze how the company generates revenue
   - Identify pricing models, subscription tiers, or monetization strategies

   - Look for information about unit economics and margins if available

4. **Technology Assessment**
   - Identify the core technologies and frameworks used
   - Research their tech stack from job postings, engineering blogs, or GitHub
   - Determine any proprietary technologies or patents

5. **Market Size Analysis**
   - Research the Total Addressable Market (TAM) using multiple sources
   - Find industry reports, market analyses, and competitor statements
   - Calculate TAM using both top-down and bottom-up approaches
   - For top-down: Find overall market size from research reports
   - For bottom-up: Estimate potential customers × average revenue per customer
   - Always include numerical estimates with sources

6. **Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM) Calculation**
   - Determine the portion of TAM the company can realistically target
   - Consider geographical limitations, product capabilities, and target segments
   - Calculate as a percentage of TAM with justification
   - Always include numerical estimates with sources

7. **Growth Metrics Research**
   - Find historical and projected growth rates
   - Look for user/customer acquisition numbers, revenue growth
   - Identify key performance indicators specific to their industry
   - Search for funding history and valuation progression

8. **Client/Customer Research**
   - Identify major clients or customer segments
   - Look for case studies, testimonials, or public references
   - Research customer retention rates if available

9. **Social Media Analysis**
   - Find all relevant social media accounts
   - Assess follower counts and engagement metrics
   - Identify key messaging and positioning

10. **Competitive Landscape Mapping**
    - Identify direct and indirect competitors
    - Research competitor market share and positioning
    - Look for competitive advantages and differentiators

11. **Media Coverage Review**
    - Find recent news articles, press releases, and media mentions
    - Identify key announcements, partnerships, or milestones
    - Look for sentiment and industry perception

## RESEARCH GUIDELINES

- For each step, clearly explain what you're researching and why
- Use multiple sources to verify information
- Prioritize recent information (within the last 1-2 years)
- When estimates conflict, provide a range and explain the discrepancy
- For market sizes (TAM/SAM), always include:
  * Numerical values (in $ billions/millions)
  * Growth rates (CAGR)
  * Sources for your estimates
  * Year of the estimate
  * Methodology used (top-down or bottom-up)

## MARKET SIZE RESEARCH TECHNIQUES

For TAM/SAM research, use these specific techniques:

1. **Industry Report Method**: Search for market research reports from firms like Gartner, Forrester, or IDC
2. **Competitor Analysis Method**: Sum the market shares of known competitors
3. **Public Company Method**: Analyze public companies' annual reports in the same sector
4. **Bottom-up Calculation**: Estimate: (Total potential customers) × (Average selling price)
5. **Investor Presentation Method**: Search for market size data in startup pitch decks or investor presentations
